## How Javascript Works

### Summary

1. How Javascript works
   - Everything in javascript happens inside an **Execution context**.
2. Execution context has two components
   - Memory Component or Variable Environment
     - This is the place where all **variables and functions are stored as key value pairs**. eg -
       {key:value || n:2};
   - code component or thread of execution
     - This is the place where code is **executed one line at a time**
3. Javascript is **synchronous single-threaded language**
   - Single threaded means **Javascript can executed one command at a time**
   - Synchronous single-threaded that means Javascript can **executed one command at at time in specific order**.
